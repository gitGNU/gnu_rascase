The Rascase source code comes with a Python style installation method, using 
setuptools.

Build
The build step is necessary even when running from source so as to ensure that 
the extensions are built.

$ python setup.py build
	
Install
Installation is the recommended method to run Rascase. If you want to run it
from the source you should jump to the Developers section.

# python setup.py install
	
You may need to use sudo or equivalent to obtain superuser access if you are
installing to a global location.

Developers
If you want to develop rascase, the recommended method to let available the
python modules that comes with the project, is run the following command.

# python setup.py develop

With this the setup will put just a link that points the sources, so if you
change content of some of the file you can just run rascase, because the
changed will be available immediately.
