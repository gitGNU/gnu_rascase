Rascase is free software as in free speech.

I'm doing this with the intention of learn more about the database design 
and to give a simple tool to the free software communities.

This tool is mainly focused on the design of entity-relationship models, and
not in the development of physical data models, but this second feature will not
be excluded of rascase.

The requirements to run rascase are at least:
* pygtk 2.12
* pygoocanvas

NOTE: some dependencies could be added without warning until the first release 
candidate.


The colors used are inspired in the palettes recommended by the tango project
